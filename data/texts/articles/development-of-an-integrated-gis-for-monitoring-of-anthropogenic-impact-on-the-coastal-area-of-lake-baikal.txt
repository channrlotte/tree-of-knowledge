Investigation into the causes of the ecological crisis is possible as a result of multicenter studies of the coast and off-shore strip. The development of unified technical and methodological approaches in the assessment of the impact of contaminated subterranean water on the ecosystem is the basis for complex geological-geophysical, geological, geochemical, hydrochemical, hydrological, hydro biological, microbiological, landscape, diving and other researches.
Complex study management involves processing of large amounts of distributed data accumulated during the studies, and needs for their integration and analysis, require the use of modern methods, use of information technology (IT) and tools to support scientific research. Since the studies are interdisciplinary and require the prompt presentation of materials from a large number of scientists from different fields of knowledge, such a system must be multiple-user. Because of the spatial nature of the data, geoinformation systems (GIS) are a suitable tool for the research support on the anthropogenic impact on the ecology of any territory. The implementation of such GIS with open architecture will provide the opportunity to expand functionality by adding new services that are both locally on the geoportal server and remotely on other servers. System development for assessing and monitoring of human impact as a geoportal has a number of advantages:
•	High reliability of data storage;
•	Absence of user needs to install and maintain software on his own;
•	Free access to methods, models and algorithms of data geoprocessing, the possibility of the list of geo-algorithms expanding;
•	The ability to apply high-performance computing to resource-intensive geoprocessing applications.
In this article, an approach for informational support of human impact on the ecology of the coastal zone of Lake Baikal research is suggested. The geoportal of the Irkutsk Scientific Center allows for investigators to make a general database of issue-related data (tabulated data) and map data (information layers), as well as to start-up Internet services for geoprocessing and for complex analysis of various indicators. One of the key features of the geoportal is the ability for users to independently create the structure of their databases (add, delete and modify the structure of tables), and also to adjust start-up of geoprocessing services. This platform allows to take on projects on a variety of topics for a large number of users simultaneously.

Установление причин экологического кризиса возможно в результате комплексных исследований побережья и прибрежной акватории. Разработка единых методических и методологических подходов в оценке воздействия загрязненных подземных вод на экосистему является основой комплексных геолого-геофизических, геологических, геохимических, гидрохимических, гидрологических, гидробиологических, микробиологических, ландшафтных, водолазных и других исследований.
Проведение комплексных исследований сопряжено с обработкой больших объемов накопленных в рамках исследований распределенных данных, необходимостью их комплексирования, анализа и требует применения современных методов, использования информационных технологий (ИТ) и инструментальных средств для поддержки научных исследований. Поскольку исследования имеют междисциплинарный характер и нуждаются в оперативном представлении материалов большого количества ученых из разных областей знаний, такая система должна быть многопользовательской. Из-за пространственного характера данных подходящим инструментом поддержки исследований антропогенного воздействия на экологию какой-либо территории являются геоинформационные системы (ГИС). Реализация такой ГИС с открытой архитектурой обеспечит возможность расширения функциональности за счет добавления новых сервисов, находящихся как локально на сервере геопортала, так и удаленно на других серверах.
Разработка системы для оценки и мониторинга антропогенного воздействия в виде геопортала имеет ряд преимуществ:
•	высокая надежность хранения данных;
•	отсутствие потребности пользователям самостоятельно устанавливать и обслуживать программное обеспечение;
•	свободный доступ к методам, моделям и алгоритмам геообработки данных, возможность расширения перечня геоалгоритмов;
•	возможность применять для ресурсоемких приложений геообработки системы высокопроизводительных вычислений.
В данной статье предложен подход по информационной поддержке исследований антропогенного воздействия на экологию прибрежной зоны озера Байкал. Геопортал Иркутского научного центра позволяет исследователям формировать общую базу тематических данных (табличные данные) и картографических данных (информационные слои), а также осуществлять запуск
интернет-сервисов для решения задач геообработки и комплексного анализа различных показателей. Одной из отличительных особенностей геопортала является возможность пользователям самостоятельно создавать структуру своих баз данных (добавлять, удалять и модифицировать структуру таблиц), а также настраивать запуск сервисов геообработки. Данная платформа позволяет вести проекты по тематике различной направленностии большому количеству пользователей одновременно.

Introduction
Currently the shore of Lake Baikal becomes more and more attractive place for development of tourist activities, and moreover it remains one of the most relevant places with relation to ecological demands and restrictions as it concerns a unique natural object % Lake Baikal.
A serious impendence of ecological safety of Lake Baikal is posed by accompanying economic activity, especially in the absence of engineering constructions. It is explained by the fact that on the coast of Lake Baikal there is a large number of the local sections of mass tourism and rest that are characterized by permanently growth of tourist flow that finally leads to deterioration of the unique ecological system of Lake Baikal status for that reason acceptance of urgent measures for the analysis and assessment of the current state and for the forecast of dynamics of geosystems on key sections is required: Listvyanka village, Maloye sea cost, coastal area near Severobaikalsk and Baikalsk. The situation thickens by the fact that at the moment groundwater runoff from industrial enterprises, tourism objects, private farms and accommodation units to a surface watercourse is not regulated by any normative documents and thus there is no united methodological approaches to keep records of the factor influence on ecological system of a surface water body.
The lack of methodological approaches the most clearly has appeared on Baikal where a large-scale ecological crisis began to take off in 2011 (mainly due to a sharp increase in the tourist flow) which resulted the following events occurred in the coastal zone of the lake:
-	mashrooming of filamentous green algae of the Spirogyra kind, atypical for the lake Baikal;
-	accumulation of the mass of dead algae and the formation of algobacterial tufts;
-	nearly total death of endemic Baikal sponges in the coastal zone of the water area at depths of 3 to 30 m;
-	cyanobacteria develop on dead sponges and near them including number of excreting ekssitoksin.
In this context Listvyanka village is considered as a typical example of a settlement located on the shore of the lake Baikal where tourism is widely developing and which was determined as an object of study on identification of the true causes of eutrophication of the coastal zone. In the village of Listvyanka there are many private houses and hotels of various sizes whose sanitary wastewater is not provided with sewage system and enters septic tanks (often not hermetical), where from liquid fecal matter as well as sewage resulting from the use of showers and bath houses, laundering with washing powders, containing a significant amount of phosphorus, pass to Baikal. And while the cause of the ecological crisis of Lake Baikal has not yet been clearly identified it is expected that it can be entry of large amounts of nutrients into the lake % nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, causing the
eutrophication of shallow water. Therefore it is supposed to establish a direct connection between the arrival of untreated sewage in the shallows of Lake Baikal and the development of filamentous algae and the sponges death.
At the moment the problem of scientific geoinformation environmental monitoring system creating which is at the initial stage of its formation is being solved. Academic and operating geoinformation presentation of materials to ensure the solution of problems of ecologically sustainable development of territories based on new geoinformation methods and technologies, has become a capstone of scientists' activities, and the task is to develop new hydrophysical methods of searching and adequate determining of the locations of subsoil unloading in assessing the impact on the lake Baikal.
Geoportal of Irkutsk Scientific Center Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences
The main component of the developed service-oriented IAS (information and analytical system) is a geoportal that provides users with the exchange of spatial and thematic data and services for their processing based on OGC standards (Fig. 1). As defined the geoportal is a general access point to information resources (data) and processing technologies.
Software design of the geoportal "client-server" consists of the following components:
-	Content management system Calipso % implements user management functions, webpage slicing, etc.;
-	Data base PostgreSQL (with extension for spatial data processing PostGIS) % is intended for user data storage;
-	Data storage system (SCD) % software and hardware for user data storing;
Fig. 1. Software design of GIS of anthropoge niedevelopme nt
-	Services for input and editing of relational data % allow users to create their own tables with spatial attributes, view and edit tabular data, maps;
-	Subsystem of start and status accounting of the execution of WPS services % manages WPS services;
-	WPS-services % contain algorithms for data processing and analysis, it can be located locally and remotely on the Internet.
Interface of tables input and editing
The interface for tables input and editing is formed on the basis of structural specifications that contain information about the table, attributes and their properties. Data input and editing is carried out in a table or on a form. The user interface generation module sequentially bypasses all the attributes indicated in the specification. The corresponding control element for each attribute is used to generate input fields on the form and in the table cell. Along with that spatial attributes additionally create WMS layers to display data on the map. You can sort and filter the data in the created table by all attributes.
The use of control elements allows users to create a flexible interface without programming to work with relational tables with any set of attributes. Currently more than twenty different control elements have been developed that permit you to work with standard data types: number, string, date, boolean, etc.
Data mapping
Table data representation on server side is performed using Mapserver under WMS standard and on the client side using the leaflet library. Mapserver performs data mapping using a special configuration file (MAP) which describes data access settings, used projections, data display styles and so on. The MAP file keeps a request to PostgreSQL to retrieve data from the tables of the basic spatial data and the user table. A new MAP file with a unique name is dynamically created for each layer of the browser's window containing the map. This allows users to simultaneously view the layer with different filters settings and display styles (Fig. 2). Change of filters or display styles will automatically change the configuration file.
Fig. 2. Data mapping and application of spatial filter
Generalization and aggregation of tabular data
A mechanism of data grouping is implemented to aggregate information in the services of input and editing of relational data. Within the interface you can select the fields for grouping the table entries the remaining fields require you to select a group function. For line-oriented fields you can select a group function to count the number of entries in a group. For number fields you can choose one of the following functions: maximum, minimum, average values, quantity. The entries grouping can be made for all types of fields by values equatation.
